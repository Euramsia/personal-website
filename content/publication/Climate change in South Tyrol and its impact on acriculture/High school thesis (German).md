This is the thesis I wrote in my last year at the high school with a specialization in agriculture. I summarized the effects of the climate change in South Tyrol with regard to its impact on the local agriculture and how the different sectors can react to it. For this thesis I was won the Seppel-Lamprecht-Stipend.
