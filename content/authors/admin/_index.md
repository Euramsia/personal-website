I am an early career researcher in the field of cancer genomics based in the Netherlands. I started my PhD in 2025 at the van Boxtel Group at the Prinses Maxima Center for child oncology. My goal is to work mainly computationally but to deepen my understanding of the data with occasional wetlab projects.

My previous work was on local-global perception bias, a concept in cognitive psychology that attempts to describe how local visual stimuli are integrated into larger global figures and the various effects involved in this process.

While the cognitive research was intriguing, I decided to deepen my biological skills with a pure bio-PhD. In the future I hope to combine the two. Let's see what comes of that.

Furthermore, I am interested in Open Science, which I think is key for a positive and collaborative relationship within academia and between academia and society.
