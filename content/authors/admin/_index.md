I am a research assistant at Utrecht University, exploring in-depth the decades-old yet still poorly understood concept of visual local-global perception bias. My background is Molecular Biology (BSc) and Neuroscience and Cognition (MSc), with a strong interest in quantitative and computational approaches.

Past reserach was biologically-focused (microbiology and genetics) and for my future I aim to combine as many research interests as possible, with a focus on human genetics, especially in the topics of neurobiology and ageing. 

Furthermore I am very interested in promoting Open Science, which I think is key for a positive and collaborative relationship within academia and between academia and society.
