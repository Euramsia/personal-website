I am currently researching local global perception bias, but my interests cover a wide range of topics and I am searching for a field where I can combine as many as possible of them. My academic path so far has covered nearly everything between chemistry and psychology at least to some degree, while my work was focused on microbiological and genetic research on one hand and cognitive psychology on the other hand. 

Furthermore I am very interested in promoting Open Science, when I find time for it, in particular Open Data, alternative publishing models, and the recognition and rewards aspect of academia.
