I am a beginning researcher based in the Netherlands. I recently completed a research assistantship at the deparment of Experimental Psychology at Utrecht University, exploring the poorly understood concept of visual local-global perception bias. My educational background is **Molecular Biology (BSc)** and **Neuroscience and Cognition (MSc)**, with a strong interest in quantitative and computational approaches.

During my Bachelor's I gained experience in wetlab microbiology and genetics, kindling a deep fascination with DNA. After concluding my current statistical and modelling-based cognition research, I will therefore turn to biologically-focused research, especially my main interest **genetics** with a systems perspective, but over the long term I would also like to touch on neurobiology, ageing, and/or cognition.

For the next step of my academic career, I am therefore **searching for a PhD position** in genetics with a focus on bioinformatics.

Furthermore, I am very interested in promoting **Open Science**, which I think is key for a positive and collaborative relationship within academia and between academia and society.
