Storytelling has always been fascinating to me. As a child and teenager I was an avid reader and I loved books. So much so, that I attemted to write books myself. My perfectionism prevented me from finishing, but I have hundreds of pages of worldbuilding and story drafts still laying around, just waiting to be finally written as story. At some point I hope to come around, but currently I just don't have the time.

Therefore, I settled on something a bit shorter, that had also interested me for some time: How to tell a story in a video. Not a particular story, just how to make *a* story oit of any event. The hiking trip in Sweden with a friend of mine was the perfect opportunity for me to explore the world of motion picture storytelling. Fixed chronology, clear start end end, lots of small issues to be solved, lots of material to cut, combine, and arrange. Also photos by my friend that I used to express our child-like joy at all the red houses.

But boy had I underestimated how much work cutting and editing the main video would be ... I ended up working 50+ hours for one hour of playtime. Especially, because I wasn't certain what the pace of the story should be. The travel Youtuber Shiey was a big inspiration, already for recording the material, but it was still difficult to translate that inspiration to a consistent narration; which level of details to show when in service of what.

With feedback from friends and family I tuned and polished, until I felt like additional effort wasn't justified anymore, especially given the limits of the source material. Cutting and editing is powerful, but there is only so much one can do with a given source material. Even though if I would do this today, I would make different choices, I am still fairly content with the fruits of my labour. The videos have barely a dozen views, mostly from friends, but for me, the most important part was to actually make them and turn the disjointed Go-Pro clips into a real story.
