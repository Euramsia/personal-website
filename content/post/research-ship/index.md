![Me](me.jpg "Me, on a ship, on the Atlantic")

Ever since I read about the research vessel *Polarstern* in the children's magazine Geolino I wanted to to research on such a ship. I still remember how 12 year old me was sitting in on the sunny floor and imagined myself into the freezing arctic on an important research mission.

But I was little and it was just a dream, unachieveable, nearly forgotten over the years. That is, until one day towards the end of my Bachelor's, I came to talk about childhood dreams with a friend of mine, who had a seafaring friend. Meeting her I learned that it was indeed possible for a guy like me without a focus on marine research to find his way onto a research ship, and she gave me advice how to do it.

Once I knew where to look it was easy to find lead scientists going on a cruise and contact them and I almost secured a place, but this was the winter of 19/20 ... so you know what came in between. Cruises were put on ice, travel was restricted, final hopes were crushed in spring, and I turned to [fundraising](https://felixschweigkofler.com/post/fundraising/) and preparing for my Master's in Utrecht.

In the following years I attempted again and again to secure a spot on a cruise, but Covid measures made plannind difficult, administrative hurdles were raised, and cruises clashed with important dates from my study. But the determination was there, so it was just a matter of time. Finally, in 2023, I started again in earnest to search for dozens of cruises, tracked down the lead scientist, and emailed them. It was the work of hours and days. Answers began to trickle in. Mostly very friendly and helpful, but all of them a no. Spots are hard sought-after and cruises filled for many months in advance. Some vague promises for the future was the best I got and I was almost ready to find international ships, when I opened one more mail, expecting yet another friendly rejection of my hopes, but it wasn't. That time, it was an offer.

An assistant had cancelled and they needed a helping hand within mere weeks. Too soon! Too soon, as I still had to organize personal things in Utrecht. I dreaded the possibility that yet another chance would slip through my fingers, but luck was with me this time. Just weeks after I began the last search, but more than a decade after a boy began to dream, I set foot on a major research vessel. To do science on the ocean. It was geophysics instead of biology and the Atlantic instead of the Arctic, but that didn't matter. I made it. After all the effort and failures, I once again had achieved a dream. A dream whose fulfilment had become so important to me and into which I had poured so much energy, that standing there on the ship felt more like the end of a journey, than the beginning. It felt a bit unreal.

I had feared that alongside the single-minded effort to overcome all barriers my expectations for the journey might have grown too much, but luckily they hadn't. The cruise gave quite exactely me the experience I hoped for. We were putting out measuring devices and monitoring the ship's own ongoing measurements of the seafloor and it all felt properly exciting and significant. The topic was far off my expertise, but I learned quickly about the intent behind our research and could get interested in the glimpses of preliminary results we were seeing. To do all that on the ocean is a very peculiar feeling. Surrounded by just water, confined to a ship, it feels as if the world has become very small. It is just the ship now, and just these people. Everything else becomes a vague possibily in the distance. The day is dominated by the routine of the ship. The outside world is far. The usual worries of life diminish. As if the ship was in its own dimension.

I want to believe that even this last part is something my 12-year-old self intuitively felt, when he dreamed himself on this ship.
