But I was little and it was just a dream, deemed unachieveable, forgotten over the years. Until I came to talk about it with a friend towards the end of my Bachelor's, who had a seafaring friend. Meeting her I learned that it was indeed possible for a guy like me to find his way onto a ship, and she gave me advice how to do it.
