Ever since I read about the research vessel *Polarstern* in the children's magazine Geolino I wanted to to research on such a ship. I still remember how 12 year old me was sitting in on the sunny floor and imagined myself into the freezing arctic on an important research mission.

But I was little and it was just a dream, deemed unachieveable, forgotten over the years. Until I came to talk about it with a friend towards the end of my Bachelor's, who had a seafaring friend. Meeting her I learned that it was indeed possible for a guy like me to find his way onto a ship, and she gave me advice how to do it.

Once I knew where to look it was easy to find lead scientists going on a cruise that I could contact and I almost secured a place, but this was the winter of 19/20 ... so you know what came in between. Cruises were put on ice, final hopes were crushed in spring, and I turned to fundraising and preparing for my Master in Utrecht.

In the following years I attempted again and again to secure a spot on a cruise, but administrative hurdles were raised, cruises clashed with important dates from my study, and my focus was on my study. But during all that time, the determination lingered and if I am determined to do something I will do it eventually. So, finally, in 2023, I started again in earnest to search for cruises, tracked down the lead scientist, put them in a list, and emailed them. All 60+ researchers and organizing entities I had found for my first wave. It was the work of hours and days. Answers began to trickle in. Mostly very friendly and helpful, but all of them a no. Spots are hard sought-after and cruises filled for months or years in advance. I got some vague promises for the future, but nothing substantial, and I was almost ready to search for contact details of the second bach of international agencies and ships when I opened yet another mail, expecting yet another friendly rejection of my hopes, but it wasn't. It was an offer.

An assistant had cancelled and they needed a helping hand within mere weeks! Too soon, too soon, as I still had to organize personal things in Utrecht and I dreaded the posdibility that yet another chance would slip through my fingers. But kuck was with me this time. Just weeks after I began my search, but more than a decade after a story sparked a dream in a boy, I set foot on a major research vessel. To do science on the ocean. It was geophysics instead of biology and the Atlantic instead of the Arctic, but that didn't matter. I made it. After all the effort and failures, I once again had achieved a dream. Standing there on the ship felt almost more like the end of a journey, than the beginning. It felt a bit unreal.

Right after we left port I got very seasick in the rough water. After the waves calmed down in the next days and my brain got a bit more used to it, I could join the team and help with the research, putting out measuring devices and monitoring the ship's
