What is molecular biology? The study of living organisms on a molecular level. Joke aside, in this post I will try to explain in relatively simple terms what MolBio is about in its core. 

> The short answer is: **"Molecular biology is about explaining life"**

Not per se the human experience between conception and death, but rather how *living* actually works on a fundamental biological, chemical, and also physical level. That is a lot, but I'll keep it reasonably simple and clear.

### A BRIEF HISTORY OF BIOLOGY

Living things surround humans ever since and were thus the object of curiosity. Biology has some pretty obvious domains, like plants and animals and how they behave and what grows where and what doesn't and which herb cures which diseases. Thousands of years of observations, secretes from druid mouth to druid ear and farmer's wisdom. But all this old knowledge hit against a wall, when it came to _understanding_ the phenomena that were observed. Even worse where the attempts to describe life philosophically or religiously. Many scholars from ancient times tried their best to explain why things happen by mixing psychological, biological, and chemical/physical phenomena, with a good dose of philosophy and creativity.

Only with the rise of modern science, the veil over the secret of life was lifted, bit by bit, finding by finding, in many scholarly disputes. However, the veil was found to be bigger and bigger and even bigger than it was ever imagined, and so we are still looking for answers to an ever increasing number of questions. Answers that must be found on a very fundamental level, so let's go molecular!

I tried to condense fundamental aspects of molecular biology into five main concepts. Inaccurate, sure, but hopefully helpful. I even drew a picture in paint for the visual learners!

### FIVE ELEMENTS OF LIFE

The ancient Greeks and Chinese already knew that life must be composed of subparts. With this they were right. Then they tried to identify these subparts and identified elements such as earth, fire, and metal. With this they were wrong, but the approach is still relevant. Life does consist of "elements" and for a study of life, we need to work with general concepts, so I will present my own five fundamental "elements" of life:

Life needs a **defined space** withing borders because it is a state of complex order in a hostile environment. Inside, molecules can interact fairly undisturbed and in a controlled manner, while the vast outside is chaos and cannot be controlled by a cell. These borders are cell walls and cell membranes.

Life needs **building blocks** (molecules of all types), and it needs an incredible variety of them. They are too complex to exist "by default" in our universe, thus they must be created. Doing _anything_ for a cell usually means building specific molecules and using their specific impact on other molecules. The effect of that specific molecule can be anything from being building material over activating other molecules to "reading" information.

Life needs **information** as a blueprint for the molecules that must be built. Those molecules are not created by chance, but rather with a rigorous plan. This information is stored in the DNA and "read" by specific molecules. 

Life needs **energy**. Who doesn't? Without energy, nothing can be done. Simply maintaining order already needs constant effort, otherwise things tend to become chaotic. Energy is either prduced trough photosynthesis or by "eating" energy-rich molecules like sugar.

Life needs **work** - or in other words: something, that performs necessary tasks. Even though chemical reactions happen all the time, you need to put in some extra effort to get the reactions you really want and something needs to control this. In the case of life the "workers" are special molecules called enzymes.

With the models developed over the last two centuries we are able to explain life with an astonishing complexity. I will explain them a bit further in the next part

### SOME MORE DETAILS

We have seen, that life can be broken down to five concepts and that everything a cell needs is made out of molecules.

Now, lets expand on them a little bit.

Information is stored in the DNA and read by enzymes in order to duplicate the DNA or to produce proteins with the information they get. This is a step-by-step process: each bit of information is a special chemical structure that is "read" and which causes the enzyme to do a certain thing. This is the reading process. At the end we either have a second string of DNA or a protein.

Proteins are huge molecules, consisting of thousands or ten thousands of atoms. Water, in comparison, consists of three atoms. Proteins have two main functions. They either build a structure, a tunnel for water to flow in and out, for example. Or they can *do* things like "reading" the information of the DNA, then they are called enzymes. Enzymes are like micro-robots with a very specific task, they are the workers who control most of the chemical reactions happening in a cell.

Enzymes do about everything that is relevant in a cell. Without them the cell could not use food, reproduce, fight off attacking cells or react to a sudden increase of temperature. They are responsible for building everything, including other proteins with the information of the DNA, but also the cell wall for example. They take a certain molecule and attach it to the cell wall to make it stronger. Where does the molecule come from? A bunch of other enzymes have made it. And how? By using building blocks, provided by other classes of enzymes, and of course with energy.

Energy is key, without it nothing would work, no car moves, the internet is dead and so would be our cells. Energy can be gained from chemical reactions. In principle, it is the same as burning wood, but instead of the quadrillions of reactions which make up a fire, the cells perform only a few, which are enough for her to live. The cell also is able to store a good part of the energy in a more convenient form - like humans use the energy from power plants and store it in a battery to power a cell phone, which works perfectly fine, while the phone would be destroyed by the heat of the power plant. It is all about clever systems and proper management of resources, for humans and even more so for life itself. All of this is done by enzymes, of course.

### Final thoughts

Ok so what should we do with this knowledge?

Molecular biology, like all science, does not happen in a disconnected bubble, but is integrated in our societies. Our values, our ideas, our rules determine the progress and focus of science and are in turn changed by scientific findings. We need to think about the future of science collectively and how we want to use it, because knowledge and progress will not be halted, but must be used smartly. And you are a part of this.

> Inform yourself, inform others, build yourself a philosophy and envision a future for *life*. We now have the capabilities to make it real.
