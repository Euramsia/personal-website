Local-global bias is a psychological theory that describes the perception of local and global information in so-called hierarchical compound figures. Which of the two lower stimuli is more similar to the upper stimulus? The left figure has the same "local" elements and the right figure has the same "global" shape.

This may seem like a philosophical question, but for your brain it isn't. At least not when you only get a brief (< 1 sec) glimpse of the top figure and then need to decide. Now it is a cognitive task.

Many questions around this task are still unanswered. Does your response even tell us something about you, or is it random? Does it say something about your current emotional state? Do autists have a bias towards the local elements? Do gays have a bias towards the local elements? (that's a real [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00013/full))

Regadless of the research question, however, it is paramount that the conceptu of the task is well-understood and the effects used in a clear and defined manner. However, I think there are significant shortcomings in (part of) the current literature.

With my research under guidance of Prof. [Stefan van der Stigchel](https://www.stefanvanderstigchel.nl/) I am working on a clear explanation of the effect structure, supported by empirical evidence from more than a dozen studies ([openly available](https://osf.io/xtrhe/)). Papers are currently under review or to be submitted.
