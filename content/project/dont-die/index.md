[Meal table](Meals.xlsx "Table v6") [Excel table; ingredients, nutrition, importance, costs, buy links]  
[Additional info](Meals.docx "Document v6") [Word document; preparation advice, warnings]  
Current version: v8, 13.3.2025 (previous version are included as well); I will occasionally update these documents.  

### Why tho?

After 25, the thought that my body was now decaying hit me harder than expected. With this motivation I started looking more seriously into healthy living. After many half-assed attempts earlier in my life, I now (try to) follow an incremental approach that works best for me. If I have a clear, pragmatic, and functional structure that is written down I can maintain it more easily and also get back into it more easily if I temporarily fell out of it due to external or internal circumstances.

The documents above are some meals that I designed and eat regularly. I began putting them here after several friends asked me for my recipes and sending the documents individually became tedious. Please remember, many other aspects are relevant for a healthy life, such as good sleep, a good social life, and mental health. For a while I took blueprint supplements, but their was some controversy around product quality and they seem their trustworthiness has become more doubtful, so I stopped. I am looking to put together my own mix of supplements from independent sources.
