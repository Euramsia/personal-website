After 25, the realisation that I was now walking towards my grave hit me stronger than expected. I realised, that I should now finally give proper attention to my body, the attention it deserves. After many half-assed attempts earlier in my life, I now found a structured and incremental approach that works well for me, that gives me the freedom to adapt slowly and find what works for me.

I started with a few supplements, Vit D because I had a light deficit, Vit B12 because I started to go vegetarian, Omega 3 because it is Omega 3, then I found Bryan Johnson's Blueprint, added some more supplememts, and started to design my own meals, modelled after his meals but adapted for myself.

After interest from some friends I started sharing my breakfast plan and it's following iterations with more meals added. When I hit a dozen, I decided it is time to put it here.
