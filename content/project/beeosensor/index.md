The American Foulbrood (AFB) is the second-most dangerous bee disease after the Varroa mite. The AFB-bacteria _Paenibacillus larvae_ turn the bee larvae into infectious brown slime that can wipe out a whole colony. When the beekeeper notices the danger it is often already too late to treat the disease successfully and the hive is usually burned to avoid spreading. This can be avoided if the bacteria are detected early enough when their concentration in the colony is still very low.

For the international student competition iGEM 2019 our team proved that the spores of the bacterium can be detected by using a biosensor covered with _P. larvae_ bacteriophages. To make the sensor a viable tool requires tuning the sensor to reliably detect very low concentrations. A business model for the sensor could be to give the sensor away for free and charge for the electrodes necessary for each measurement.

The full documentation of the project is available in the wiki-system of iGEM.
