**Open Science means proper science.**

It is a deep conviction of mine that we as academia have a responsibility for humanity that demands from us to be effective in our research and transparent in our communication. This simplified demand becomes all-ecompassing, because it concerns the very basis of how we do research.

Note: This does not affect the scientific method itself, but a reform of the social enterprise of doing science. The scientific method is developing models to abstract reality and testing these models on reality. It is essentially what every child does when it tries to understand the world, but we do it in a highly stuctured, rigoros and accumulating way.

Open science as a reform movement on the other hand is about how exactly we implement research in our social structure, such as:
- Who pays whom for what?
- Who gets rewarded for what? <font color="grey">(the publish or perish culture produces mediocre research)</font>
- How do we disseminate the knowledge? <font color="grey">(scientific publishing hasn't really discovered the internet yet)</font>
- How do we reach scientific consensus?
- Who can control what is researched?
- What is considered best practices? <font color="grey">(publishing raw data is not optional!)</font>
- How we can criticise research? <font color="grey">(no comment section under papers where researchers can discuss, are you serious?)</font>

These topics have nothing to do with the scientific method itself, but they are at the core of what academia is and does. They decide how good our science can be. 

**Doing my part.**

Utrecht University's **Road to Open Science** podcast ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/R2OSpodcast), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6GvtmgOjs4lc76Aiz9RO46), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/utrechtyoungacademy)) talks with Open Science enthusiasts who contribute to the movement. It explores the many topics in academia that are touched by OS. My favourite episode is the ["Faces of Open Science"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5s435lLwFcIPMjv6IxZugB), where we had two philosophers of science who found "archetypes" within the OS movement. Doing interview was a blast and really helped me to structure some vage understanding of science and scientists and what different movations and values there are.

I am a co-founder of **SIOS**, the [Student Initiative for Open Science](https://openscience-utrecht.com/sios-utrecht-1/). We are supported by the Open Science Community Utrecht (OSCU) and are developing a framework of how to best bring Open Science to students. Our ideas include brief weekly [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AHprT0mosw) about OS-topics and lobbying for Open Science in education.

My [master thesis](https://www.felixschweigkofler.com/project/local-global/) about local-global perception bias is preregistered on the [open science framework](https://osf.io/n8sge/), and I will make data and code available, as well as publish my paper with open access.

My future research will be strongly focused on the Open Science aspect and try to incorporate the best practices to make my research as transparent and accessible as possible.

**Doing your part**

- The first rule of Open Science is: Talk about Open Science.
- The second rule of Open Science is: Talk about Open Science.
- The third rule of Open Science is: There is always something that can be done better.

We need everybody! Join your local Open Science Community, reach out to other communities if there is none at your institute. Talk to people whenever you have doubts about the quality or transparency of research. Listen to the R2OS podcast - you will realize how close to the research practice many of the topics are.
